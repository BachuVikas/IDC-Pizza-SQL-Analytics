## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze pizza sales data and uncover insights related to:

- Most popular pizza categories  
- Price trends  
- Customer order behavior  
- Sales performance  
- Category-level and size-level demand  
- Missing data & data quality checks  

I created everything using **MySQL Workbench**, including tables, data loads, all SQL queries, and a final PPT summarizing insights.

## 🗄️ Database Schema (4 Tables)

- **pizza_types** → categories, names, ingredients  
- **pizzas** → pizza variations by size + price  
- **orders** → order timestamps  
- **order_details** → items per order  

All tables combined give a complete view of pizza sales operations.
